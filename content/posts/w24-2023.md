[Mars Rendered](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/) {{< sub "(murray-lab.caltech.edu)" >}} | [[:speech_balloon: discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36322395)] - The Bruce Murray Laboratory for Planetary Visualization has completed a 5.7 terapixel mosaic of the surface of Mars rendered at 5.0 m/px.

[Pricing Money](https://www.jdawiseman.com/books/pricing-money/Pricing_Money_JDAWiseman.html) {{< sub "(jdawiseman.com)" >}} | [[:speech_balloon: discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36358754)] - Pricing Money is a beginner’s guide: it says so in big letters on the front cover.
